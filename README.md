# Speccy

This is my attempt at making a legit SRB2 (Sonic Robo Blast 2: https://srb2.org) character. I started work on the actual character back in 2020 when it was just tails sprites with a carbon skincolor. Now Speccy's... still a tails recolor, just that it's prerendered sprites. :dramahog:

Jokes aside, she plays very differently compared to most other characters.

She contains (or will contain) the following:

An HP System, Leveling System, XP System, and Item System.               
(Custom Items, and Custom Boss DMG / XP values are supported. You can force a level up as well.)

Multiple HUDs to choose from, along with allowing more custom HUDs via Lua support.            
(I guess you would just, insert your HUD into an array of other hud functions.)

Special Unlockables, be it Items, Multipliers, or even Achievements!           
(And obviously it has support for custom stuff too!)

Last of all, Speccy will be getting built-in support for a couple of already released add-ons, such as Kirby.
And some unfinished ones too, like MRCE! (Mystic Realm Community Edition: https://gitlab.com/team-prismatic/mystic-realm-ce)

I hope you'll enjoy it once it's a finished product!
